# WP-Radar

## Overview
WP-Radar is a security testing tool for WordPress sites. It tests the effectiveness of security of a website by simulating real-world attacks.

WP-Radar evaluates site security by recreating a real threat scenario, but in a safe and controlled environment. It emulates the vulnerability on a site, without creating one. So when the external WP-Radar plugin looks for a vulnerability to exploit on your site, the internal WP-Radar plugin presents a dummy target.

WP-Radar is developed to test for classes of vulnerabilities and their associated attacks, not specific vulnerabilities in particular plugins or themes. These attacks are based on the most common vulnerabilities found in WordPress sites.
